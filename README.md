# music_etl_to_pg_project

Hi there!

This is a project in which I am organizing and optimizing music app metadata.

The data is currently stored in json across two datasets. 
I will be design a Postgres Database for music analytica with an OLAP approach to optimize for read querries. 
Then I will create an ETL pipline to move the data into the database.
