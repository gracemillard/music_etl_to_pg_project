Hi there!

This is a class project in which I am organizing and optimizing music app metadata.

The data is currently stored in json across two datasets.
I will be design a Postgres Database for music analytica with an OLAP approach to optimize for read querries.
Then I will create an ETL pipline to move the data into the database.
